# 🚀 21-Day SQL Challenge — Day 1: Introduction to SQL, SELECT Statement & LIMIT

Starting my SQL learning journey with Day 1!  
Today, I focused on retrieving specific columns from a table, exploring the structure of the data, and limiting the number of records returned.

---

## 📌 Task of the Day
Fetch all unique hospital services available in the records.

---

## 🧩 Query Used
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
    service 
FROM
    services_weekly;

📚 Key Learnings

SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to interact with relational databases.

SELECT retrieves data from one or more columns in a table.

Limiting columns helps in getting only the relevant information.

Understanding the table structure before querying is beneficial.

🔑 Key Notes

LIMIT controls how many records are returned, useful for large datasets.

DESC or DESCRIBE commands help check column details and types.

AS can rename columns temporarily to improve readability.
